<br />
<br />
Uncheck "Block all public access". This allows public (anyone on the internet) access to your bucket: <br/>
 - This comes with risk but is out of the scope of this project 

Select "Create Bucket" to create the bucket


In your bucket, navigate to the "properties" tab, scroll all the way down and select "edit" under "static website hosting"

Enable static website hosting

Give a name to your "index document" (this is usually index.html), then save changes
- Note that the main source code has to have the same name as your "index document"

Upload your website source code
- Note that the main source code has to have the same name as your "index document"

Click the bucket website endpoint under "static website hosting" and note that you get an error. This is because the bucket policy has not be updated to grant public access:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To grant public access, click on the "Permissions" tab within the bucket and edit the bucket policy to the policy below
- Note that you must update the "Resource" to your buckets' ARN which can be found at the top left when you click on edit bucket policy
- Also note the "/*" at the end of the ARN, this gives access to every file within the bucket  <br/>
